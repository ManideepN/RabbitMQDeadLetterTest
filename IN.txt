Hello
 

 
 Developer tools are automatically disabled when running a fully packaged application. If your application is launched from java -jar or if it is started from a special classloader, then it is considered a “production application”. Flagging the dependency as optional in Maven or using compileOnly in Gradle is a best practice that prevents devtools from being transitively applied to other modules that use your project.
